FlyreelPanorama is a Swift framework for capturing a 360 panorama, handling the entire flow from tutorial and 360 capture to provide the local file URL paths of the final captured bundle. This framework supports integration via Swift Package Manager, and can be used in both SwiftUI and UIKit codebases.

## Features

- SwiftUI/UIKit support
- Tutorial flow
- 360 panorama capture
- Local paths to stored bundle files

## Installation

## Usage

### SwiftUI Example

The following example demonstrates how to present the panorama capture view using the `panoramaCaptureView` modifier:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import FlyreelPanorama

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isCaptureViewPresented = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Capture Panorama") {
                isCaptureViewPresented = true
            }
        }
        .panoramaCaptureView(
            isPresented: $isCaptureViewPresented,
            clientID: "your-client-id",
            onCaptureCompletion: { localScanBundleURLs in
                if !localScanBundleURLs.isEmpty {
                    print("Scan URLs: \(localScanBundleURLs)")
                } else {
                    print("Scan was not completed")
                }
            }
        )
    }
}
```

### UIKit Example

The following example demonstrates how to present the panorama capture view using the `presentFNOLCaptureView` extension:

```swift
import UIKit
import FlyreelPanorama

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBAction func showPanoramaCaptureFlow(_ sender: UIButton) {
        self.presentPanoramaCaptureView(clientID: "your-client-id") { localScanBundleURLs in
            if !localScanBundleURLs.isEmpty {
                print("Scan URLs: \(localScanBundleURLs)")
            } else {
                print("Scan was not completed")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## API Reference

### panoramaCaptureView

View instance modifier that presents panorama capture view as a full-screen cover.

#### Declaration

```swift
func panoramaCaptureView(
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    clientID: String,
    onCaptureCompletion: @escaping ([URL]) -> Void
) -> some View
```

#### Parameters

- `isPresented`: A binding that controls whether the capture view is presented.
- `clientID`: A string representing the client ID required for authentication.
- `onCaptureCompletion`: A closure executed upon scan completion, providing an array of local URLs to the captured files.

### presentPanoramaCaptureView

View controller extension that presents panorama capture view as a full-screen cover.

#### Declaration

```swift
func presentPanoramaCaptureView(
    clientID: String,
    onCaptureCompletion: @escaping ([URL]) -> Void
)
```

#### Parameters

- `clientID`: A string representing the client ID required for authentication.
- `onCaptureCompletion`: A closure executed upon scan completion, providing an array of local URLs to the captured files.

## Permissions

To use the camera in your app, you need to add the following to your app's `Info.plist` file:

- `NSCameraUsageDescription`: A message that tells the user why your app needs access to the camera.

Here is an example of the key and value:

```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to capture images of your claim.</string>
```
